# Movie Recommendation

The Movie Recommendation AI is a web-based application that leverages OpenAI's powerful language model, GPT-3.5-turbo, to provide personalized movie recommendations. Users can input their favorite genre, a movie they like, and their preferred movie length. The AI then generates recommendations based on these inputs, offering the name of the movie, a brief introduction, main actors, duration, and genre. This application is built using Streamlit for the user interface, making it interactive and easy to use.
